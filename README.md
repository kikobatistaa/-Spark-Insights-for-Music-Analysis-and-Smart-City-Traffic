# Big Data Analysis with Apache Spark: Spotify Music Analysis & Traffic Prediction for Smart Cities

## Overview
In an era where data is the new gold, this project harnesses the power of Apache Spark on Databricks to demonstrate how big data technologies can unlock transformative value through two compelling use cases:

- **Spotify Music Analysis**
- **Traffic Prediction for Smart Cities**

These case studies explore how Spark’s distributed computing capabilities can process massive datasets to extract actionable insights, from identifying global music trends to optimizing urban traffic flow.

## Use Cases

### 1. **Spotify Music Analysis**
Music streaming platforms like Spotify have transformed the way we listen to and discover music. In this project, we process and analyze Spotify’s music data to:
- **Analyze Popularity**: Examine the popularity of songs over time.
- **Artist Collaboration Analysis**: Identify collaboration trends between artists and visualize top collaborations.
- **Playlist Creation**: Group songs based on similar characteristics using clustering techniques to create personalized playlists.

Key steps include:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning using Spark DataFrames.
- Time-based analysis and clustering with K-means for playlist creation.
- Artist collaboration analysis using graph algorithms (GraphFrames).

### 2. **Traffic Prediction for Smart Cities**
This use case aims to demonstrate how Spark can optimize urban traffic management by predicting congestion patterns and enabling smarter decision-making. The project leverages machine learning models to predict traffic bottlenecks and optimize traffic flow.

Key steps include:
- **Traffic Data Ingestion**: Processing large datasets from multiple sensors.
- **Congestion Prediction**: Using machine learning models built on Spark MLlib for predictive analysis.
- **Real-time Traffic Prediction**: Implementing Spark Streaming for live data analysis and congestion management.

### Goals:
- Ingest and analyze large-scale traffic data using Spark’s distributed data processing capabilities.
- Predict traffic congestion using historical and real-time data.
- Provide actionable insights for smarter traffic decision-making (e.g., optimizing traffic light timings and planning road expansions).

## Methodology

### Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
- **Traffic Data**: Stored in Parquet format for optimized retrieval and processing.
- **Spotify Data**: Ingested as a Spark DataFrame with predefined struct types.
- **Feature Engineering**: Time-based and lag features engineered to capture traffic patterns.
- **Graph-based Analysis**: Used GraphFrames for artist collaboration analysis in Spotify music data.

### Machine Learning & Modeling
- **Traffic Prediction**: Developed predictive models using Spark MLlib Pipelines.
- **Music Playlist Creation**: Applied K-means clustering for personalized playlist generation.
- **Real-time Streaming**: Implemented Spark Streaming for live traffic data analysis and real-time decision-making.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Apache Spark**: Distributed data processing.
- **Databricks**: Cloud-based analytics platform for big data.
- **Spark MLlib**: Machine learning library for predictive modeling.
- **GraphFrames**: For graph-based analysis of artist collaborations.
- **Parquet**: Optimized storage format for large datasets.

## Key Insights

### Spotify Music Analysis:
- **Trends Over Time**: We analyzed how song popularity evolved over the years, with a focus on post-2006 due to Spotify’s inception.
- **Collaborations**: We explored and visualized artist collaborations, with specific analysis on Beethoven’s top 40 collaborations.
- **Music Characteristics**: Grouped songs into clusters based on their musical features for personalized playlist creation.

### Traffic Prediction for Smart Cities:
- **Congestion Prediction**: The model predicts congestion patterns and optimizes traffic flow based on historical and real-time data.
- **Real-time Traffic Optimization**: Spark Streaming enables real-time analysis, empowering city planners with actionable insights.
- **Scalability**: The solution is scalable and capable of handling data streams from multiple sensors across the city.

## Value Proposition
- **Reduced Congestion**: Predict and mitigate traffic bottlenecks.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Save on fuel and infrastructure costs through optimized traffic management.
- **Improved Mobility**: Enhance the overall quality of life by improving urban traffic flow.

## How to Run the Project

### Requirements:
- Apache Spark 3.x
